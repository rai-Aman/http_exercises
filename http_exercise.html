        <h1>Q1. What is HyperText Transfer Protocol(HTTP)?</h1>
        <p class="para">
               => It is an application layer protocol that is mostly used to send hypermedia documents such as HTML. The
                communication between the web browser and the web server is maintained using HTTP. It always utilizes
                port 80 for communication.

                Due to the lack of security, communication is sometimes regarded as a risky endeavor.

                encryption. As a result, it only works on Application layer.It does not necessitate any type of
                qualification. As a result, it is one of the most commonly used protocols.

                for the transport of data
                <br />
        </p>
        <h1>Q2. Why HTTP is called Stateless Protocol?</h1>
        <p class="para">
               => The connection will be dropped or terminated once the request is made and the response is sent back to
                the user or clients. As a result, the server will forget all of the requests sent by clients. As a
                result, the server does not maintain track of any state data. As a result, HTTP is known as the
                Stateless Protocol.
                <br />
        </p>
        <h1>
                Q3. Describe the three phases of establishing a session using
                Client-server Protocols such as HTTP
        </h1>
        <p class="para">

                => The client-server paradigm is a distributed application structure that divides tasks or labor between
                servers, which provide a resource or service, and clients, who request that service. Session has three
                phases in client-server protocols like HTTP:-
                <br />
                <b>1. Establishing TCP connection: </b>
                Clients establish the connection in this protocol. Establishing a connection in HTTP means initiating a
                connection in the underlying transport layer, which is commonly TCP, with the default port for HTTP
                being 80.
                The url of the page's function is to fetch both the domain name and the port number.
                <br /><br />

                <b>2. Sending a client request and waiting for response :</b>
                Once the connection is established, the web browser sends the request to the server, which is divided
                into three blocks and separated by CRLF:- <br />
                a. The first line comprises a demand, which is followed by its parameters, such as the document's path
                and the HTTP protocol version.<br />
                b. The following lines constitute an HTTP header, which informs the server about the sorts of data that
                are acceptable.<br />
                c. The following sections make up an HTTP header, which tells the server what kind of data is allowed.

                <br /><br />

                <b>3. The server responds to the request by returning a response with a status code and appropriate
                        data :</b>
                The web server processes the request provided by the connected agent and eventually delivers a response.
                A server response is composed of text instructions separated by CRLF, similar to a client request,
                except it is broken into three blocks:
                <br /><br />
                The first line, the status line, contains an acknowledgement of the HTTP version used, followed by a
                status request (and its short human-readable meaning).Following lines indicate particular HTTP headers,
                which provide information to the client about the data transmitted (e.g., type, data size, compression
                technique used, caching hints).These HTTP headers create a block that ends with an empty line, similar
                to the block of HTTP headers for a client request. The last block is a data block, which includes the
                information that is optional data.

        <h1>Q4. Describe the parameters on a get and post request.</h1>
        <p class="para">
                => The GET method requests a data representation of the specified resource.
                Requests using GET should only retrieve data. <br> <br>The POST method sends data
                to a server so it may change its state. This is the method often used for
                HTML Forms.
        </p>
        <h1>
                Q5. What are the HTTP response status code and What do the HTTP status
                codes, 200, and 404 indicate?
        </h1>
        <p class="para">
               => HTTP response status codes determines whether a specific HTTP request has
                been successfully completed or not. Responses are grouped in five
                classes:<br /><br />
                i. Informational responses (100–199)<br />
                ii. Successful responses (200–299)<br />
                iii. Redirects (300–399)<br />
                iv. Client errors (400–499)<br />
                v. Server errors (500–599) HTTP status codes 200 indicate: request has
                succeeded. HTTP status codes 404 indicate: server can not find the
                requested resource. In the browser, this means the URL is not recognized.
        </p>
        <h1>Q6. What are HTTP Cookies? Give an example.</h1>
        <p class="para">
                => A small piece of data or files that a server sends to the user's web
                browser is called cookies. For example, if Path=/docs is set, these paths
                match: /docs. /docs/Web/ /docs/Web/HTTP.
        </p>
        <h1>Q7. Why are cookies a security issue?</h1>
        <p class="para">
                => In reality, cookies do produce a few problems. They can be altered via
                malicious customers considering that it is stored on the neighborhood
                device. Cookies can also be used to thieve periods of another consumer and
                as a result can commit fraudulent acts. They can also be used for
                monitoring the browsing records of a user. so that cookies are a security
                issues.
        </p>
        <h1>Q8. Describe session hijacking and XSS</h1>
        <p class="para">
                => The session hijacking assault consists of the exploitation of the internet
                session manipulate mechanism, that's normallymanaged for a session token.
                ... The session hijacking assault compromises the consultation token via
                stealing orpredicting a legitimate session token to advantage unauthorized
                access to the web server. This is probably the maximum risky and enormous
                approach of internet consultation hijacking. With the aid of
                exploitingserver or application vulnerabilities, attackers can inject
                patron-facet scripts (generally javascript) into web pages,causing your
                browser to execute arbitrary code while it masses a compromised web page.
                If the server doesn’t set thehttponly characteristic in session cookies,
                injected scripts can advantage get right of entry to on your session
                key,supplying attackers with the necessary statistics for session
                hijacking.
        </p>
        <h1>Q9. Describe Cross-site request forgery(CSRF)</h1>
        <p class="para">
                => Csrf is an attack that tricks the sufferer into submitting a malicious
                request. It inherits the identity and privilegesof the victim to carry out
                an undesired characteristic at the sufferer’s behalf. For maximum sites,
                browser requestsmechanically encompass any credentials related to the
                site, including the user’s consultation cookie, ip deal with, homewindows
                area credentials, and so on. Consequently, if the user is currently
                authenticated to the web site, the websiteonline will have no way to
                distinguish among the cast request despatched via the victim and a valid
                request despatchedwith the aid of the sufferer. Csrf assaults goal
                capability that causes a nation trade on the server, which include
                converting the sufferer’s e-mail cope with or password, or buying
                something. Forcing the victim to retrieve statistics doesn’t advantage an
                attacker due to the fact the attacker doesn’t get hold of the reaction,
                the victim does. As such, csrf assaults goal kingdom-changing requests.
                <br />
                It’s occasionally viable to save the csrf attack on the vulnerable website
                online itself. Such vulnerabilities are called “saved csrf flaws”. This
                could be carried out by way of simply storing an img or iframe tag in a
                area that accepts html, or by using a greater complex pass-site scripting
                attack. If the assault can shop a csrf assault within the website online,
                the severity of the attack is amplified. Specifically, the likelihood is
                accelerated because the victim is much more likely to view the web page
                containing the attack than some random page on the internet. The chance is
                also increased due to the fact the victim is sure to be authenticated to
                the web site already.

        <h1>
                Q10. What are Cross-site HTTP request (CORS) and what requests use CORS?
        </h1>
        <p class="para">
                => Pass-origin aid sharing (cors) is an http-header based mechanism that
                allows a server to suggest another origins (domain, scheme, or port) than
                its own from which a browser should allow loading of sources. Cors
                additionally is predicated on a mechanism by which browsers make a
                “preflight” request to the server website hosting the pass-beginning
                useful resource, in order to test that the server will permit the actual
                request. In that preflight, the browser sends headers that indicate the
                http approach and headers in an effort to be used within the actual
                request. An example of a go-origin request: the front-stop javascript code
                served from https://area-a.Com uses xmlhttprequest to make a request for
                https://area-b.Com/data.Json. For security reasons, browsers limit
                move-origin http requests initiated from scripts. For example,
                xmlhttprequest and the fetch api comply with the equal-beginning policy.
                Which means a web software using the ones apis can most effective request
                sources from the identical foundation the utility was loaded from except
                the reaction from other origins consists of the right cors headers.
